# Flask logging is broken, and it is a time bomb: by default it does nothing,
# but the first time an exception happens, it creates a new logger that
# interferes with normal python logging, which messes up all subsequent log
# messages.  This bug was reported in
# https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/641 and is expected to be fixed in
# the future when Flask 1.0 ships.  Referring to app.logger forces this
# creation via Flask's logger property handler.  We then clean up the mess it
# makes
